Deadlock vs livelock

=>Deadlock is a situation in which 2 or more competing actions are each waiting for the other to
finish, and thus neither ever does.
=>Databases deadlock happens when 2 process each within its own transaction updates two rows of
the information but in the opposite order
For example, Process A updates Row 1 and then Row2 in the exact time frame that Process B updates
Row 2 then Row1.
=>Operating system: a deadlock is a situation which occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting
state because a resource requested is held by another waiting process, which in turn waiting for 
a resource held by another waiting process.

LIVELOCK:

=> A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread.
=> If the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread -> Livelock
=> LivLocked threads are unable to  make further progress, however the threads are not blocked.
they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work.
=> Like two people attempting to pass in a narrow corridor.
A moves to his left to let B pass, B moves to his right to let A pass.
They are still blocking each other A moves to his right A moves to his left...still not good.
