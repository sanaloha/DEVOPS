With Reentrant Locks

1) We can make a lock fair: prevent thread starvation, Synchronized blocks are unfair by default.
2) We can check whether the given lock held  or not with Rentrant locks.
3) We can get the list of threads waiting for the given lock with Rentrant locks.
4) Synchronized blocks are nicer: We do not need try-catch-finally blocks.
