Hi
in this video we are going to talk about concurrent hash maps.

I'm not sure whether you're familiar with data structures but the collections framework in Java 
contains lots of lots of built in data structures such as Array lists link list stacks to use 
hash maps tree maps, sets and so on.
So we are able to store the data in a very very convenient manner.
But there's a huge problem with these kinds of collections related data structures that if we want to
manipulate the data within these data structures with multiple threads then the data may end up in an
inconsistent state which means that we are going to manipulate the same data in the given data 
structure. And the problem may arise.
What we have seen in the first section. OK here we are going to talk about the most important 
concurrent And so basically thread safe data structure the so-called concurrent hash map.

So I'm going to create two threads for example the first thread is going to put items into the hash 
table and the other thread is going to take item from the hash table.
OK so I'm going to create our first ever worker that implements the Runnable interface as usual it's
going to store a reference to concurrent map as an interface.
We are going to store key value pairs as usual the keys are going to be string and the values are
going to be integers.
