Angular
========================================================

Lec#4 Installation

	--Install nodejs
	--install angular CLI
		Once you've successfully installed it using the installer, we can think about setting up an Angular application because this is actually what we'll start with in this course.
		For this, we'll use another tool called the Angular CLI. CLI stands for Command Line Interface and it's the de facto way of creating Angular apps.
		Because of the more complex build workflow I mentioned, we need a lot of tools that compile our code,
		optimize it and setting all of that up on our own is pretty cumbersome and error-prone.
		The CLI gives us a project setup where all of that is taken care of and where we can focus on writing
		our Angular code; our logic.
		The CLI is installed like this and it uses NPM,
		the Node Package Manager, to install the CLI tool globally on our machine
		
		--npm install -g @angular/cli
		with ng new (this is a command now available due to the CLI package and is basically a command made available by that)
